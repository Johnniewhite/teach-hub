Events
Festival of Change 
The Festival of Change is an annual conference that responds to global challenges threatening the stability and future of our generations. This event is a platform where bold ideas are generated to tackle these problems. Each Festival of Change is designed to spearhead solutions through keynote addresses, panel discussions, and innovative activities. The ultimate goals of the conference are to inspire the creation of startups focused on solutions, foster collaborations and partnerships centered on these solutions, and provide mentorship and networking opportunities that grant access to resources needed to accelerate impactful initiatives.
At the pioneering Festival of Change, inspired by the African Union’s declaration of a State of Emergency on Education, we are driven by a passion to revitalize education in Nigeria. This conference will explore the roles of the Business, Government, and Development sectors in reviving and transforming the educational landscape in Nigeria.
